What is Analyze Mesh?
---------------------------------

`Analyze Mesh <https://blendermarket.com/products/analyse-mesh/>`_ is a free Blender Extension for 3D modelers who want to quickly check their mesh topology for `quads, tris, ngons <https://resources.turbosquid.com/training/modeling/tris-quads-n-gons/>`_ and edge `poles <https://resources.turbosquid.com/training/modeling/poles/>`_.

Originally part of `Quad Maker <https://blendermarket.com/products/quad-maker/>`_, Analyze Mesh is now available for free to provide a quick and easy way to check the topology of any mesh based object in Blender.

Features

* Simply select the object and click the *Analyze Mesh* button from the side tab.

* The add-on will give you a snapshot of the total number of vertices, edges, faces, tris, quads, ngons, and poles in the mesh when in Edit or Object mode.

* Once analysed, select the different mesh elements from the panel (when in Edit mode).

* Analyze in Edit or Object modes:

    * In **Edit mode**, the add-on will analyze the base mesh elements.

    * In **Object mode**, the add-on will analyze the entire mesh with modifiers included.

* Refresh by clicking the *Re-Analyze Mesh* button again in order to save on performance.
